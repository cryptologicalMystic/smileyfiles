	<p>If you got here in the first place, you probably already know what's going on. In case you don't:</p>
	<p>The "gods" of this world (or "ghostwriters", which is totally a better term that I'm going to try to use from now on because hell if I'm giving them the ego boost) have a Discord group chat.</p>
	<p>Think that sounds stupid? It is. Oh, trust me, it fucking is.</p>
	<h3>Patachats</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="trashcouncil musechat 2020-02-09.html">2020-02-09</a>: the original clusterfuck, which proceeded to set the stage for all subsequent clusterfucks</li>
		<li><span class="strike white">2020-02-23</span>: I'm in the process of fixing it as we speak. Somehow managed to outdo #1 on the list for clusterfuckery.</li>
		<li>Everything between 2020-02-23 and 2020-03-04: Haha no. I'm not fixing all those tuppers manually. Besides, all you need to know is:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>It was a giant stack of recursive clusterfucks</li>
				<li>There was therapy</li>
				<li>lolBerg and lolGlass joined just in time to escape a dual containment breach of lol173 and lol096</li>
				<li>People died (unsurprising)</li>
				<li class="patahide-b">Lots of deleted blogs around 03-01 - poss. "war in heaven"?</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><a href="musechats/trashcouncil musechat 2020-03-05">2020-03-05</a>: Glory be to a godchat that was surprisingly NOT a clusterfuck! Only one person died! =D</li>
